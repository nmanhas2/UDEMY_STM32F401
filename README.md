Bare-metal STM32 projects I've made while following this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-systems-bare-metal-programming/

Using this NUCLEO Dev-board: https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html

I've also included resources like the datasheet, reference manual, a book on embedded C, etc., that I have been using throughout the course.
