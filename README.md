Bare-metal STM32 projects I've made while following this course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-systems-bare-metal-programming/](url)

Using this NUCLEO Dev-board: [https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html](url)

Used this package to obtain the header file used for some of the projects: [https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef4.html](url). You only need Drivers -> CSMSIS -> Device and Include folders

I've also included resources like the datasheet, reference manual, a book on embedded C, etc., that I have been using throughout the course. A lot of the comments that I've put are mostly for my own learning purposes, so I can look back on specific concepts. The documentation has a lot of references, such as mentioning the section number within the Reference Manual that contains information about a specific register, which is mainly just to show my understanding of sifting through documentation to find the information I need.
